# ShoBot-DiscordBot

This project is a simple Discord bot written in .NET Core for monitoring the status of Asheron's Call emulator servers. It is very basic and will alert status changes and respond to !status and !beerme messages in chat. All configuration is done in the appsettings.json file.

Here are some references for getting your Discord bot set up and your channel id:

A huge thanks to Thwargle for all his work but specifically the ThwargLauncher that was used as a reference to monitor server status.
